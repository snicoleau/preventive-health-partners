            <p>In 2024, 66% of Physicians reported using healthcare AI, marking a 78% increase from 38% in 2023. Applications include clinical documentation, billing code generation, and assistive diagnostics, with AI also used in patient outreach and scheduling.</p>
            <p><strong>Physicians’ Perspective:</strong></p>
            <p>"AI has been the best tool for improving my healthcare efficiency... It makes things easier. The notes are concise, well-organized, legally robust, and never include imaginary diagnoses." – Nabla, General Medicine Physician, April 2024</p>
            <p>"A family medicine doctor reported a significant reduction in time spent on patient documentation—from an additional 10–20 hours weekly to just 15 minutes daily—after integrating Suki AI into her practice." – Business Insider, September 25, 2024</p>
